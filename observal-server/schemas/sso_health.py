"""Per-check diagnostic schema for the SSO health validators.

Each probe contributes one check ``{name, label, status, message?, hint?}``.
The aggregate response is ``{ok, latency_ms, checks: [...], ...}`` where ``ok``
is False if *any* check has status "fail" — but every check still runs, so the
operator sees every problem in a single round-trip.
