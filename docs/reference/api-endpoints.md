## Rate limiting

Auth endpoints are subject to `RATE_LIMIT_AUTH` and `RATE_LIMIT_AUTH_STRICT`. Non-auth endpoints are not rate-limited by default — put a reverse proxy or API gateway in front if you need it.

## Request size limits

`MAX_REQUEST_SIZE_MB` (default `10`) caps body size on all endpoints. Large telemetry batches may need tuning.
